# VSS â€“ Vector Space Search 

A simple vector space search engine with tf*idf ranking. 

[More info, and details of how it works.](http://madeofcode.com/posts/69-vss-a-vector-space-search-engine-in-ruby)

## Requirements

Ruby >= 1.8.7. Tested in (MRI 1.8.7 + 1.9.2).

## Install

Just install the gem:

```bash
gem install vss
```

## Usage

To perform a search on a collection of documents:

```ruby
require "vss"
docs = ["hello", "goodbye", "hello and goodbye", "hello, hello!"]
engine = VSS::Engine.new(docs)
engine.search("hello") #=> ["hello", "hello, hello!", "hello and goodbye", "goodbye"]
```
    
## Rails/ActiveRecord

If you want to search a collection of `ActiveRecord` objects, you need to pass a **documentizer** `Proc` when initializing `VSS::Engine` which will convert the objects into documents (which are simply strings). For example:

```ruby
class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
    #attrs: title, content
end

docs = Page.all
documentizer = lambda { |record| record.title + " " + record.content }
engine = VSS::Engine.new(docs, documentizer)
```

## Notes

This isn't designed to be used on huge collections of records. The original use case was for ranking a smallish set of `ActiveRecord` results obtained via a query (using **SearchLogic**). So, essentially, the search consisted of 2 stages; getting the *corpus* via a SQL query, then doing the VSS on that.
